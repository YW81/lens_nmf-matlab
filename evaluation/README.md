# Evaluation Measures for Topic Modeling Algorithms

This package includes MATLAB implementations for two evaluation measures:

* `Topic coherence (PMI)`
* `Total document coverage`

Topic Coherence
----------------
**pmi.m** is a program for calculating PMI within a topic or topics. When A is a nonnegative matrix,

    pmi(A, Wtopk_idx, mcnt, epsilon)

returns a matrix of PMI values.
The four parameters are mandatory, and the details are as follows.

* `A`      -  Input matrix (m x n)
* `Wtopk_idx` -  Cell array containing matrix/matrices with indices for top keywords 
* `mcnt`  -  Number of models (e.g. Standard NMF, Sparse NMF, etc.)
* `epsilon`           -  Value for preventing log(0)

One usage example is provided in **example_pmi.m**.


Total Document Coverage
----------------
**compute_total_doc_cvrg.m** is a program for calculating total document coverage for a topic or topics.

    compute_total_doc_cvrg(A, term_idx, min_nterm)

returns two values, which are as follows.

* `qualtopic` - Number of documents covered by each topic (1 x k) where k is number of topics
* `tot_cvrg` - Total number of documents covered by k topics (1 x 1)

The three parameters are mandatory, and the details are as follows.

* `A`      -  Input matrix (m x n)
* `term_idx` -  Cell array containing matrix/matrices with indices for top keywords 
* `min_nterm`  -  Minimum number of keywords document must have (c2 in References[1])

One usage example is provided in **example_total_doc_cvrg.m**.
