# Localized Ensemble of Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (L-EnsNMF) 
============

This package includes MATLAB implementations for L-EnsNMF as well as other state-of-the-art topic modeling methods.
The methods are as follows. 

* 'Standard NMF'
* 'Sparse NMF' 
* 'Orthogonal NMF'
* 'LDA'
* 'L-EnsNMF'

## Experiment
---------------
**main.m** is a program for running experiment(s) on dataset(s) using the above methods.
The program returns topic keywords of each topic modeling method and evaluation results.
Some of them are as follows.

* 'Wtopk' - cell array (1 x mcnt) where mcnt is the number of methods
* 'speed' - cell array (1 x mcnt) where mcnt is the number of methods
* 'totcvrg_mat' - matrix (k x mcnt) where c1 is the number of keywords

## Evaluation
---------------
This package includes two evaluation measures:
 
* 'Topic coherence'
* 'Total document coverage'

While one can see how it can be used from **main.m**, they have separate,simple usage example files, **example_pmi.m** and **example_total_doc_cvrg.m**.
More details about them can be found [here](https://github.com/sanghosuh/lens_nmf-matlab/evaluation/).
